Squire is a web-based collaborative software development environment with a project development center. Squire will allow multiple users to edit files and communicate in real time. Projects can be stubbed out and then other users can join and/or vote to support for their favorite projects. After a certain amount of support, planning, and documentation is reached for a project, the project becomes a fully fleged project and then community development can start. Think "kickstarter for code" where people pledge their help with the project and not just financial support.

## Official Documentation
